# Claude Session Changes - Calendar Development

This document describes all the changes made during a Claude Code session to fix calendar scroll synchronization and improve event card visibility.

## Files Modified in PR

### 1. `apps/calendar/src/components/calendar-week.tsx`
**Main Issue**: Time gutter not scrolling with calendar viewport, breaking on agenda/grid mode transitions

**Changes Made**:
- **Replaced useRef with callback ref pattern**: Converted `scrollRootRef` from `useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)` to `useCallback((scrollAreaElement: HTMLDivElement | null) => {})` for more reliable DOM element tracking
- **Added scroll position preservation**: Introduced `savedScrollTopRef` to store scroll position between re-renders, preventing unwanted jumps back to 8AM when selecting events
- **Improved viewport detection**: Added multiple selector fallbacks and better error handling for finding the scroll viewport element
- **Fixed scroll sync logic**: Changed from `translateY(${t}px)` to `translateY(-${scrollTop}px)` for correct synchronization
- **Added display mode awareness**: Scroll sync only runs in grid mode and properly cleans up when switching to agenda mode
- **Enhanced debugging**: Added console logging for troubleshooting scroll sync issues

**Technical Details**:
- The callback ref fires immediately when the ScrollArea DOM element is mounted/unmounted, eliminating race conditions with AnimatePresence transitions
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth initial synchronization
- Implements progressive retry logic (immediate, 50ms, 100ms delays) for robust initialization

### 2. `apps/calendar/src/components/event-card.tsx`
**Main Issue**: Event cards had poor visual distinction from background, especially in dark mode

**Changes Made**:
- **Enhanced color scheme**: Replaced very dark colors (e.g., `bg-neutral-950`) with brighter, more contrasting colors (`bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800`)
- **Improved borders**: Upgraded from thin `border` to `border-2` with category-specific border colors
- **Added shadows**: Implemented shadow system (`shadow-sm` default, `shadow-md` on hover, `shadow-lg` when selected/highlighted)
- **Fixed click behavior**: Added `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` to prevent unwanted scrolling when selecting events
- **Better dark mode support**: Adjusted default card colors to use `bg-neutral-800` in dark mode for better visibility

**Color System Changes**:
- Each category now returns `{ bg, text, border }` instead of just `{ bg, text }`
- Light mode uses 100-level colors, dark mode uses 800-900 level colors for better contrast
- Default cards use neutral colors with proper fallbacks

### 3. `apps/calendar/.env.local` (Created)
**Purpose**: Environment configuration for calendar app to connect to Supabase

**Contents**:
```env
# Supabase Configuration (Local Development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:55321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJleHAiOjE5ODM4MTI5OTZ9.CRXP1A7WOeoJeXxjNni43kdQwgnWNReilDMblYTn_I0

# Mastra Agent Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_URL=http://localhost:3020

# OpenRouter API (for AI features)
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here
```

**Why needed**: The calendar app was throwing Supabase client errors because it couldn't find the required environment variables for database connection.

### 4. `scripts/dev.js` (Minor changes)
**Issue**: Mastra agent was failing to start due to EBUSY error on Windows file locks

**Changes attempted**:
- Initially tried changing from `pnpm dev` to direct `mastra dev` command (reverted)
- The issue was resolved by killing conflicting processes on ports 3010 and 3020
- Final solution was to use `pnpm dev` which properly manages the mastra command through package.json

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Scroll Synchronization Problems
- **Root cause**: useEffect with stale refs and timing issues with AnimatePresence
- **Solution**: Callback ref pattern that fires exactly when DOM elements are available
- **Result**: Time gutter now scrolls perfectly with calendar in all scenarios

### 2. Event Selection Causing Scroll Jumps
- **Root cause**: Component re-renders triggered scroll sync reinitialization, always resetting to 8AM
- **Solution**: Preserve scroll position in `savedScrollTopRef` between re-renders
- **Result**: Selecting events no longer causes unwanted scroll behavior

### 3. Poor Event Card Visibility
- **Root cause**: Very dark colors (950-level) blending into dark backgrounds
- **Solution**: Brighter color palette with proper light/dark mode contrast
- **Result**: Event cards clearly stand out with good readability

### 4. Mode Transition Breaking Scroll
- **Root cause**: Scroll sync not properly cleaning up/reinitializing when switching agenda ↔ grid
- **Solution**: Display mode-aware callback ref with proper cleanup
- **Result**: Scroll works seamlessly across all view mode transitions

### 5. Development Server Issues
- **Root cause**: Port conflicts and Mastra agent file locks on Windows
- **Solution**: Proper process management and port cleanup
- **Result**: All services start reliably with `pnpm dev`

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ **Scroll synchronization**: Time gutter scrolls with calendar viewport
2. ✅ **Mode transitions**: Agenda ↔ Grid transitions maintain scroll functionality
3. ✅ **Event selection**: Clicking events doesn't cause scroll jumps
4. ✅ **Visual distinction**: Event cards clearly visible in light and dark modes
5. ✅ **Color categories**: All event color categories display with proper contrast
6. ✅ **Development environment**: All services start and run properly

## Architecture Improvements

The changes represent a shift from fragile DOM manipulation patterns to more robust React patterns:

- **From useRef + useEffect**: Timing-dependent, prone to race conditions
- **To callback refs**: Immediate, reliable DOM element lifecycle tracking
- **From forced scroll positions**: Always jumping to predetermined locations
- **To preserved positions**: Maintaining user's actual scroll location
- **From basic styling**: Poor contrast and visibility
- **To systematic design**: Proper color system with shadows and borders

These changes make the calendar more reliable, visually appealing, and user-friendly.
